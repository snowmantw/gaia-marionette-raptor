# gaia-marionette-raptor

Write your Marionette + Raptor test like the `sample-test.js` (stealed from `Gaia/apps/system/test/marionette/lockscreen_media_playback_raptor_test.js`) in this directory.
It would encapsulate the Raptor part, and you can write Marionette part to perform any user behavior on the test,
then it would automatically collect the performance report.
